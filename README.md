### Running the app

1. Install Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Clone this repo
3. In the project folder, run `expo install` followed by `expo start`
4. Run the app on iOS devices by scanning the QR code, or run using an iOS simulator (the app runs on Android but we have designed the app specifically for iOS)

Note: For notifications to work on your device, you may need to sign up for an Expo account!
